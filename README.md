# Amazing-Events-Vanilla

My second programming project was developed using Vue.js and Vanilla JS. In this project, my goal was to create a website that displayed present, future, and past events, as well as calculated statistics related to the events. Additionally, I implemented a contact form so that users could communicate with the event organizers. Through this project, I was able to learn and apply my knowledge in developing more complex web applications using modern technologies.
